# Jeremy Zhu's First Portfolio Website // Jeishu
This is our first homework assign when we had to start from scratch. Using our lectures, activities, and outside resources, we had to create a website with HTML and CSS (maybe Javascript, if we are feeling comfortable with it.)

## Motivation
Besides this project being a homework, I was actually extremely excited to make my own website from scratch. Prior to this class, I had no knowledge in HTML and CSS.

## Features
This portfolio was mostly done with HTML and CSS, just one Javascript for the "scroll to top" action. No Bootstrap was used, we did not learn that in class. 
Throughout the entire website, I used a lot of pseudo element (hover, focus, after), and used small transition styles to make the motion look as clean as possible.
Utilize a good amount of media queries to help my website be more responsive to almost any screen size.

## Code-Example
I utilized spaces and comments in HTML and CSS to organize and divide the sections up.
```
  <!-- ===== Landing Page ===== -->
        <header id="mountain">
            <div class="content">
                <h1>Jeremy Zhu</h1>
                <p>
                    Web Developer in Training.
                </p>
                <a href="#nav" class="button"><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
            </div>
        </header>
        
    <!-- ===== Navigation Bar ===== -->
        <section class="navigationBar" id="nav">
            <nav>
                <ul class="navContainer" id="navbar"> 
                    <li>
                        <a href="#aboutBtn">About</a>
                    </li>
                
```
Spaces used for divding up the styles in CSS || Comments used to help indicate the Flexbox Parent
```
   /* flexbox parent :: img div.aboutInfo */
.aboutCard {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
    /* flexbox parent  :: p.name p.title p.info */
.aboutInfo {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
}
.about img {
    width: 20rem;
    height: auto;

    margin: 1rem;
    padding: 2rem;

    float: left;
    border-radius: 3rem;
    transition: all .5s;
}
```

## Tests/Issues
I utilized the Chrom Dev Tool to help fix many problems that I had encountered
- overflow-x: I had some contents, padding, margin, etc that would exceed the actual viewport.
    - this also conflicted with my Javascript, thus I had to fix the issue with my media queries.
- layout problems: I initially used CSS Grids for my website, but the CSS grids got more and more complicated, switch to Flexbox
